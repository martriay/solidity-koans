# Solidity Koans
Inspired by [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/), Solidity Koans is an introductory guide to smart contract development in ethereum through testing.
In such a critical task like smart contracts programming, writing tests is a must.

Walk through Solidity's path of enlightment with this koans.

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:martriay/solidity-koans.git
```

### 2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

## About koans
Every koan is a test written in Javacript which needs to be fixed in order to pass.

> In test-driven development (TDD) the mantra has always been red: write a failing test and run it, green: make the test pass, and refactor: look at the code and see if you can make it any better.
> With the koans, you will need to run the tests and see it fail (red), make the test pass (green), then take a moment and reflect upon the test to see what it is teaching you and improve the code to better communicate its intent (refactor).

Each koan consists of a test contract living in the `tests/` folder and may or may not involve contracts from the `contracts/` directory.
To achieve enlightment you have to run the test, see it fail and then fix the corresponding files.

To run a test contract use [`truffle`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) [`test`](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/testing):

```
$ npx truffle test test/AboutModifiers.js
Compiling ./contracts/Cup.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...


  Contract: About modifiers
    ✓ Modifiers can be used to easily change the behaviour of functions (46ms)
    ✓ Modifiers can receive arguments (50ms)


  2 passing (208ms)
```
> Note: the `npx` command [comes with npm](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) as of npm@5.2.0 version.
